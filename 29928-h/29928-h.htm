<p class="center"><i>A Note in the History
of Wood Engraving</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Thomas Bewick has been acclaimed as the pioneer of
modern wood engraving whose genius brought this popular
medium to prominence. This study shows that certain
technological developments prepared a path for Bewick
and helped give his work its unique character.</i></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>No other artist has approached Thomas Bewick
(1753-1828) as the chronicler of English rustic
life. The little wood engravings which he turned out
in such great number were records of typical scenes
and episodes, but the artist could also give them social
and moral overtones. Such an approach has attracted
numerous admirers who have held him in
esteem as an undoubted homespun genius. The fact
that he had no formal training as a wood engraver,
and actually never had a lesson in drawing, made his
native inspiration seem all the more authentic.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="The_Contemporary_View_of_Bewick" id="The_Contemporary_View_of_Bewick"></a>The Contemporary View of Bewick</h2>


<p>After 1790, when his <i>A general history of quadrupeds</i>
appeared with its vivid animals and its humorous and
mordant tailpiece vignettes, he was hailed in terms
that have hardly been matched for adulation. Certainly
no mere book illustrator ever received equal
acclaim. He was pronounced a great artist, a great
man, an outstanding moralist and reformer, and the
master of a new pictorial method. This flood of
eulogy rose increasingly during his lifetime and continued
throughout the remainder of the 19th century.
It came from literary men and women who saw him
as the artist of the common man; from the pious who
recognized him as a commentator on the vanities and
hardships of life (but who sometimes deplored the
frankness of his subjects); from bibliophiles who
welcomed him as a revolutionary illustrator; and from
fellow wood engravers for whom he was the indispensable
trail blazer.</p>

<p>During the initial wave of Bewick appreciation,
the usually sober Wordsworth wrote in the 1805 edition
of <i>Lyrical ballads</i>:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>
O now that the genius of Bewick were mine,<br />
And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne!<br />
Then the Muses might deal with me just as they chose,<br />
For I'd take my last leave both of verse and of prose.<br />
What feats would I work with my magical hand!<br />
Book learning and books would be banished the land.<br />
</p>

<p>If art critics as a class were the most conservative
in their estimates of his ability, it was one of the most
eminent, John Ruskin, whose praise went to most
extravagant lengths. Bewick, he asserted, as late as
1890,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> " ... without training, was Holbein's equal
... in this frame are set together a drawing by Hans
Holbein, and one by Thomas Bewick. I know which
is most scholarly; but I do <i>not</i> know which is best."
Linking Bewick with Botticelli as a draughtsman, he
added:<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "I know no drawing so subtle as Bewick's
since the fifteenth century, except Holbein's and
Turner's." And as a typical example of popular
appreciation, the following, from the June 1828 issue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_187" id="p_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, appearing a few months before
Bewick's death, should suffice:</p>

<blockquote><p>Have we forgotten, in our hurried and imperfect enumeration
of wise worthies,&mdash;have we forgotten "<i>The Genius that
dwells on the banks of the Tyne</i>," the matchless, Inimitable
Bewick? No. His books lie in our parlour, dining-room,
drawing-room, study-table, and are never out of place or
time. Happy old man! The delight of childhood, manhood,
decaying age!&mdash;A moral in every tail-piece&mdash;a
sermon in every vignette.</p></blockquote>

<p>This acclaim came to Bewick not only because his
subjects had a homely honesty, but also, although
not generally taken into account, because of the
brilliance and clarity with which they were printed.
Compared with the wood engravings of his predecessors,
his were more detailed and resonant in
black and white, and accordingly seemed miraculous
and unprecedented. He could engrave finer lines
and achieve better impressions in the press because
of improvements in technology which will be discussed
later, but for a century the convincing qualities
of this new technique in combination with his subject
matter led admirers to believe that he was an
artist of great stature.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> William Wordsworth, <i>Lyrical ballads</i>, London, 1805, vol. 1.
p. 199.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> John Ruskin, <i>Ariadne Florentina</i>, London, 1890, pp. 98, 99.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 246.</p></div>

<p>Later, more mature judgment has made it plain that
his contributions as a craftsman outrank his worth
as an artist. He was no Holbein, no Botticelli&mdash;it is
absurd to think of him in such terms&mdash;but he did
develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving.
Because of this he represents a turning point in the
development of this medium which led to its rise as
the great popular vehicle for illustration in the
19th century. In his hands wood engraving underwent
a special transformation; it became a means
for rendering textures and tonal values. Earlier
work on wood could not do this; it could manage
only a rudimentary suggestion of tones. The refinements
that followed, noticeable in the highly
finished products of the later 19th century, came as
a direct and natural consequence of Bewick's contributions
to the art.</p>

<p>Linton<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and a few others object to the general
claim that Bewick was the reviver or founder of
modern wood engraving, not only because the art
was practiced earlier, if almost anonymously, and
had never really died out, but also because his bold
cuts had little in common with their technician's
concern with infinite manipulation of surface tones,
a feature of later work. But this misses the main
point&mdash;that Bewick had taken the first actual steps
in the new direction.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> William Linton, <i>The masters of wood engraving</i>, London,
1889, p. 133.</p></div>

</div>

<p>Unquestionably he gave the medium a new purpose,
even though it was not generally adopted until
after 1830. Through his pupils, his unrelenting industry,
and his enormous influence he fathered a pictorial
activity that brought a vastly increased quantity
of illustrations to the public. Periodical literature,
spurred by accompanying pictures that could be
cheaply made, quickly printed, and dramatically
pointed, became a livelier force in education. Textbooks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_188" id="p_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
trade journals, dictionaries, and other publications
could more effectively teach or describe; scientific
journals could include in the body of text neat
and accurate pictures to enliven the pages and illustrate
the equipment and procedures described. Articles
on travel could now have convincingly realistic
renditions of architectural landmarks and of foreign
sights, customs, personages, and views. The wood engraving,
in short, made possible the modern illustrated
publication because, unlike copper plate engraving
or etching, it could be quickly set up with
printed matter. Its use, therefore, multiplied increasingly
until just before 1900, when it was superseded
for these purposes by the photomechanical halftone.</p>

<p>But while Bewick was the prime mover in this revolutionary
change, little attention has been given to the
important technological development that cleared
the way for him. Without it he could not have
emerged so startlingly; without it there would have
been no modern wood engraving. It is not captious
to point out the purely industrial basis for his coming
to prominence. Even had he been a greater artist, a
study of the technical means at hand would have
validity in showing the interrelation of industry and
art although, of course, the aesthetic contribution
would stand by itself.</p>

<p>But in Bewick's case the aesthetic level is not particularly
high. Good as his art was, it wore an everyday
aspect: he did not give it that additional expressive
turn found in the work of greater artists. It
should not be surprising, then, that his work was not
inimitable. It is well-known that his pupils made
many of the cuts attributed to him, making the original
drawings and engraving in his style so well that
the results form almost one indistinguishable body of
work. The pupils were competent but not gifted, yet
they could turn out wood engravings not inferior to
Bewick's own. And so we find that such capable
technicians as Nesbit, Clennell, Robinson, Hole, the
Johnsons, Harvey, and others all contributed to the
Bewick cult.</p>

<p>Linton, who worshipped him as an artist but found
him primitive as a technician, commented:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "Widely
praised by a crowd of unknowing connoisseurs and
undiscriminating collectors, we have yet, half a century
after his death, to point out how much of what is
attributed to him is really by his hand.</p>

<p>Chatto,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who obtained his information from at least
one Bewick pupil, says that many of the best tailpieces
in the <i>History of British birds</i> were drawn by Robert
Johnson, and that "the greater number of those contained
in the second volume were engraved by Clennell."
Granted that the outlook and the engraving
style were Bewick's, and that these were notable contributions,
the fact that the results were so close to his
own points more to an effective method of illustration
than to the outpourings of genius.</p>

<p>Bewick's training could not have been less promising.
Apprenticed to Ralph Beilby at the age of fourteen,
he says of his master:<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>... The work-place was filled with the coarsest kind
of steel-stamps, pipe moulds, bottle moulds, brass clock
faces, door plates, coffin plates, bookbinders letters and
stamps, steel, silver and gold seals, mourning rings, &amp;c. He
also undertook the engraving of arms, crests and cyphers,
on silver, and every kind of job from the silversmiths; also
engraving bills of exchange, bank notes, invoices, account
heads, and cards.... The higher department of engraving,
such as landscapes or historical plates, I dare say, was
hardly thought of by my master....</p></blockquote>

<p>A little engraving on wood was also done, but
Bewick tells us that his master was uncomfortable in
this field and almost always turned it over to him.
His training, obviously, was of a rough and ready sort,
based upon serviceable but routine engraving on
metal. There was no study of drawing, composition,
or any of the refinements that could be learned from
a master who had a knowledge of art. Whatever
Bewick had of the finer points of drawing and design
he must have picked up by himself.</p>

<p>When he completed his apprenticeship in 1774
at the age of twenty-one, the art of engraving and
cutting on wood was just beginning to show signs
of life after more than a century and a half of occupying
the lowest position in the graphic arts. Since it
could not produce a full gamut of tones in the gray
register, which could be managed brilliantly by the
copper plate media&mdash;line engraving, etching, mezzotint
and aquatint&mdash;it was confined to ruder and
less exacting uses, such as ornamental headbands
and tailpieces for printers and as illustrations for
cheap popular broadsides. When good illustrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_189" id="p_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
were needed in books and periodicals, copper plate
work was almost invariably used, despite the fact
that it was more costly, was much slower in execution
and printing, and had to be bound in with text in
a separate operation. But while the Society of
Arts had begun to offer prizes for engraving or
cutting on wood (Bewick received such a prize in
1775) the medium was still moribund. Dobson<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
described its status as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>During the earlier part of the eighteenth century
engraving on wood can scarcely be said to have flourished
in England. It existed&mdash;so much may be admitted&mdash;but
it existed without recognition or importance. In the
useful little <i>État des Arts en Angleterre</i>, published in 1755 by
Roquet the enameller,&mdash;a treatise so catholic in its scope
that it included both cookery and medicine,&mdash;there is no
reference to the art of wood-engraving. In the <i>Artist's
Assistant</i>, to take another book which might be expected to
afford some information, even in the fifth edition of 1788,
the subject finds no record, even though engraving on metal,
etching, mezzotinto-scraping&mdash;to say nothing of "painting
on silks, sattins, etc." are treated with sufficient detail.
Turning from these authorities to the actual woodcuts of the
period, it must be admitted that the survey is not encouraging.</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier, among other critics of the deficiencies of
the woodcut, Horace Walpole<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> had remarked:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have said, and for two reasons, shall say little of wooden
cuts; that art never was executed with any perfection in
England; engraving on metal was a final improvement of
the art, and supplied the defects of cuttings in wood. The
ancient wooden cuts were certainly carried to a great
heighth, but that was the merit of the masters, not of the
method.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="Woodcut_and_Wood_Engraving" id="Woodcut_and_Wood_Engraving"></a>Woodcut and Wood Engraving</h2>


<p>It is necessary, before continuing, to distinguish
clearly between the woodcut and the wood engraving,
not only because early writers used these terms interchangeably,
but also to determine exactly what Bewick
contributed technically. The woodcut began
with a drawing in pen-and-ink on the plank surface
of a smooth-grained wood such as pear, serviceberry,
or box. The woodcutter, using knife, gouges, and
chisels, then lowered the wood surrounding the lines
to allow the original drawing, unaltered, to be isolated
in relief (see fig. 1). Thus the block, when
inked and printed, produced facsimile impressions of
the drawing in black lines on white paper. Usually
an accomplished artist made the drawing, whereas
only a skilled craftsman was needed to do the cutting;
very few cutters were also capable of making their own
drawings.</p>

<p>The wood engraving, on the other hand, started
with a section of dense wood of a uniform texture, usually
box or maple, and with the end-grain rather than
the plank as surface. For larger engravings a number
of sections were mortised together. The drawing was
made on the block, not in pen-and-ink although this
could be done (certain types of wood engraving reproduced
pen drawings) but in gray washes with a full
range of tones. The engraver, using a burin similar
to that employed in copper plate work, then ploughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_190" id="p_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
out wood in delicate ribbons (see fig. 2). Since the
surface was to receive ink, the procedure moved from
black to white: the more lines taken away, the lighter
the tones would appear, and, conversely, where fewest
or finest lines were removed the tones would be the
darkest. In the finished print the unworked surface
printed black while each of the engraved lines showed
as white. It was the "white line" that gave wood engraving
its special quality. On the smoother end-grain
it could be manipulated with extreme fineness,
an impossibility with the plank side, which would
tear slightly or "feather" when the burin was moved
across the grain. Tones and textures approaching
the scale of copper plate engraving could be created,
except, of course, that the lines were white and the
impressions not so brilliant. But since grays were
achieved by the visual synthesis of black ink and white
paper, it mattered little whether the engraved lines
were black or white so long as the desired tones could

<p>For purposes of realism, this was an enormous improvement
over the old black-line woodcut. Natural
tones and textures could be imitated. The engraver
was no longer a mere mechanical craftsman cutting
around existing lines; special skill was needed to translate
tones in terms of white lines of varying thickness
and spacing. The opportunity also existed for each
engraver to work his own tones in his own manner, to
develop a personal system. In short, the medium
served the same purpose as copper plate line engraving,
with the added virtue that it could be printed together
with type in one impression. If it failed
artistically to measure up to line engraving or to
plank woodcut, this was not the fault of the process
but of the popular reproductive ends which it almost
invariably served.</p>

<p>Actually, white-line engraving for relief printing
dates from the 15th century. The most conspicuous
early examples are the so-called "dotted prints" or
"gravures en manière criblée," in which the designs
were brought out by dots punched in the plates, and
by occasional engraved lines (see fig. 3). Until
Koehler's<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> study made this fact plain, 19th-century
critics could hardly believe that these were merely
white-line metal relief prints, inked on the surface
like woodcuts. But a number of other examples of
the same period exist which were also made directly
on copper or type metal&mdash;the method, although rudimentary,
being similar in intent to 19th-century wood
engraving. One of these examples (fig. 4), in the collection
of the U. S. National Museum, is typical.
This was not simply an ordinary line engraving printed
in relief rather than in the usual way; the management
of the lights shows that it was planned as a
white-line engraving. The reason for this treatment,
obviously, was to permit the picture and the type to
be printed in one operation.</p>

<p>The well-known wood engravings of soldiers with
standards, executed by Urs Graf in the early 1500's,
are probably the only white-line prints in this medium
by an accomplished artist until the 18th century.
But these are mainly in outline, with little attempt
to achieve tones. No advantage was gained by having
the lines white rather than black other than an
engaging roughness in spots: the prints were simply
whimsical excursions by an inventive artist.</p>

<p>Relief engraving on type metal and end-grain wood
really got under way as a consistent process in England
at the beginning of the 18th century. Chatto<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> gives
this date as conjecture, without actual evidence, but
a first-hand account can be found in the rare and
little-known book, published in 1752, in which the
combination of anonymous authorship and a misleading
title obscured the fact that it is a digest of
John Baptist Jackson's manuscript journal. This
eminent woodcutter, who was born about 1700 and
worked in England during the early years of the
century, must be considered an important and reliable
witness. The unknown editor paraphrases
Jackson on the subject of engraving for relief purposes:<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>... I shall give a brief Account of the State of Cutting
on Wood in <i>England</i> for the Type Press before he [Jackson]
went to <i>France</i> in 1725. In the beginning of this Century a
remarkable Blow was given to all Cutters on Wood, by an
Invention of engraving on the same sort of Metal which
Types are cast with. The celebrated Mr. <i>Kirkhal</i>, an able
Engraver on Copper, is said to be the first who performed a
Relievo Work to answer the use of Cutting on Wood.
This could be dispatched much sooner, and consequently
answered the purpose of Booksellers and Printers, who
purchased those sort of Works at a much chaper [sic] Rate
than could be expected from an Engraver on Wood; it
required much more Time to execute with accuracy any
piece of Work of the same Measure with those carved on
Metal. This performance was very much in Vogue, and
continued down to this Day, to serve for Initials, Fregii and
Finali; it is called a clear Impression, but often gray and
hazy, far from coming up to that clear black Impression
produced with cutting on the side of a piece of Box-wood
or Pear-tree. Much about the same time there started
another Method of Engraving on the end ways of Wood
itself, which was cut to the height of the Letters to accompany
them in the Press, and engraved in the same
Manner as the Metal Performance; this Method was also
encouraged, and is the only way of Engraving on Wood
at present used in the English Printing-houses. These
performances are to be seen in Magazines, News Papers,
&amp;c. and are the Remains of the ancient Manner of Cutting
on Wood, and is the reason why the Curious concluded it
was intirely lost.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is important evidence that end-grain wood
engraving was not only known in England in the
early 18th century but was actually the prevailing
style. In that country, where a woodcut tradition did
not exist, the new method gained its first foothold.
But it was not yet conceived in terms of white lines;
it was merely a cheaper substitute for cutting with
the knife on the plank. In European countries with
long art and printing traditions, this substitute method
was considered beneath contempt. Jackson<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> describes
the aversion of French woodcutters for the
newer and cheaper process:</p>

<blockquote><p>From this Account it is evident that there was little
encouragement to be hoped for in <i>England</i> to a Person whose
Genius led him to prosecute his Studies in the ancient
Manner; which obliged Mr. <i>Jackson</i> to go over to the
Continent, and see what was used in the Parisian Printing-houses.
At his arrival there he found the <i>French</i> engravers
on Wood all working in the old Manner; no Metal engravers,
or any of the same performance on the end of the Wood,
was ever used or countenanced by the Printers or Booksellers
in that City.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>There were good reasons for the lack of development
of a white-line style, even in England with its lower
standards in printing and illustrative techniques. On
the coarse paper of the period fine white lines could
not be adapted to relief (typographical) presswork;
they would be lost in printing because the ribbed
paper received ink unevenly. Even the simple black<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_193" id="p_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
lines of the traditional woodcut usually printed spottily
when combined with type. The white lines, then,
had to be broadly separated. This did not permit the
engraving of delicate tones. If this could not be
achieved, the effect was similar to woodcutting but
with less crispness and accuracy in the drawing. A
good woodcut in the old manner could do everything
the wood engraving could do, before Bewick, with the
added virtue that the black line was comparatively
clear and unequivocal, as can be seen in figure 5.</p>

<p>The woodcut, in the hands of a remarkable cutter,
could produce miracles of delicacy. It could, in fact,
have black lines so fine and so closely spaced as to take
on the character of line engraving. It did not, of
course, have the range of tones or the delicacy of
modeling possible in the copper plate medium, where
every little trench cut by the burin would hold ink
BELOW the wiped-off surface, to be transferred to
dampened paper under the heavy pressure of the
cylinder press. In addition, the roughness of early
paper, which was serious for the woodcut, created no
difficulties for the line engraver or for other workers
in the intaglio or gravure media.</p>

<p>But the influence of copper plate work was strong,
and some skillful but misguided woodcut craftsmen
tried to obtain some degree of its richness. French
artists from about 1720, notably Jean M. Papillon,
produced cuts so delicate that their printing became
a problem (see fig. 6). Jackson, who had worked
with the French artist in Paris, condemned his efforts
to turn the woodcut into a tonal medium through the
creation of numerous delicate lines because such effects
were impossible to print. Jackson<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is quoted in the
<i>Enquiry</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1728 Mr. <i>Pappillon</i> began his small <i>Paris</i> Almanack,
wherein is placed Cuts (done on Wood) allusive to each
Month, with the Signs of the Zodiack, in such a Minute
Stile, that he seems to forget in that Work the Impossibility
of printing it in a Press with any Clearness ... But
alas! His father and M. <i>le Seur</i> [also woodcutters] had
examined Impression and its Process, and saw how careful
the Ancients were to keep a proper Distance between their
Lines and hatched Works, so as to produce a clean Impression ...
I saw the Almanack in a horrid Condition
before I left <i>Paris</i>, the Signs of the Zodiack wore like a
Blotch, notwithstanding the utmost Care and Diligence
the Printer used to take up very little Ink to keep them clean.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is clear that too thin a strip of white between black
lines was not suitable for printing in the first half of
the 18th century. But when Bewick's cuts after 1790
are examined we can see many white lines thinner
than a hair. Obviously something had happened to
permit him a flexibility not granted to earlier workers
on wood. Bewick's whole craft depended upon his
ability to control white lines of varying thickness.
Why was he able to do this, and why could it be done
without trouble by others after him?</p>

<p>Early paper, as already mentioned, had a ribbed
grain because it was made on a hand mould in which
wires were closely laid in one direction, but with
enough space between to allow the water in the paper
pulp to drain through. Crossing wires, set some distance
apart, held them together. Each wire, however,
made a slight impression in the finished paper, the
result being a surface with minute ripples. The surface
of this laid paper presented irregularities even after
the glazing operation, done with hammers before about
1720 and with wooden rollers up to about 1825.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In 1756 James Whatman began to manufacture a
new, smooth paper to replace the laid variety that
had been used since the importation of paper into
Europe in the 12th century. Whether Whatman or
the renowned printer John Baskerville was the guiding
spirit in this development is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Baskerville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_194" id="p_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
who had been experimenting with type faces of
a lighter and more delicate design, had been dissatisfied
with the uneven surface of laid paper. Possibly
he saw examples of the Chinese wallpaper on wove
stock, made from a cloth mesh, which was a staple
of the trade with the Orient. Hunter<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> describes
the new mould:</p>

<blockquote><p>The wove covering was made of fine brass screening
and received its name because it was woven on a loom
in about the same manner as cloth. It left in the paper an
indistinct impression resembling a fabric. Baskerville had
been in the japanning and metal-working trades before
becoming a printer, so that he was naturally familiar with
this material, metal screening having been used in England
for other purposes before it was put to use as a material
upon which to mould sheets of paper.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first book printed in Europe on wove paper
unquestionably was the Latin edition of Virgil
produced by Baskerville in 1757. This was, however,
partly on laid also. The actual paper was made in
James Whatman's mill in Maidstone, Kent, on the
banks of the river Len, where paper had been made
since the 17th century. Whatman, who became sole
owner of the mill in 1740, specialized in fine white
paper of the highest quality. But while the book attracted
considerable attention it did not immediately
divert the demand for laid paper, since it was looked
on more as an oddity than as a serious achievement.
Baskerville was strictly an artist: he took unlimited
time and pains, he had no regard for the prevailing
market, and he produced sporadically; also, he was
harshly criticized and even derided for his strange
formats.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> With such a reputation for impracticality
the printer's influence was negligible during his lifetime
although, of course, it was widely felt later.</p>

</div>

<p>Wove paper was so slow to come into use that Jenkins
gives the date 1788 for its first appearance in book
printing.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> While he missed a few examples, notably
by Baskerville, it is certain that few books with wove
paper were published before 1790. But after that
date its manufacture increased with such rapidity
that by 1805 it had supplanted laid paper for many
printing purposes.</p>

<p>The reasons for this gap between the introduction
and the acceptance of the new paper are not clear; the
inertia of tradition as well as the probable higher cost
no doubt played a part, and we may assume that early
wove paper had imperfections and other drawbacks
serious enough to cause printers to prefer the older
material.</p>

<p>Bewick's early work was printed on laid paper. Up
to 1784 he had worked in a desultory fashion on wood,
much of his time being occupied with seal cutting because
there was still no real demand for wood engraving.
In Gay's <i>Fables</i>, published in 1779, the cuts
printed so poorly on the laid paper (see fig. 7) that
Dobson<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> was moved to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Generally speaking, the printing of all these cuts, even
in the earlier editions (and it is absolutely useless to consult<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_195" id="p_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
any others), is weak and unskillful. The fine work of the
backgrounds is seldom made out, and the whole impression
is blurred and unequal.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>Even in the <i>Select fables of Aesop and others</i> of 1784,
when Bewick's special gifts began to emerge, the cuts
on laid paper appeared weak in comparison with his
later work. Bewick was still using wood engraving as
a cheaper, more quickly executed substitute for the
woodcut. The designs were based upon Croxall's
edition of <i>Aesop's Fables</i>, published in 1722, which was
probably the best and most popular illustrated book
published in England during the century up to Bewick's
time. According to Chatto, the cuts were
made with the burin on end-grain wood, probably by
Kirkall,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but Bewick believed they were engraved on
type metal.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was not easy to tell the difference.
Type metal usually made grayer impressions than
wood and sometimes, but not always, nail-head marks
appeared where the metal was fastened to the wood
base. The Croxall cuts, in turn, were adapted with
little change from 17th-century sources&mdash;etchings by
Francis Barlow and line engravings by Sebastian Le
Clerc. Bewick's cuts repeated the earlier designs but
changed the locale to the English countryside of the
late 18th century. This was to be expected; to have a
contemporary meaning the actors of the old morality
play had to appear in modern dress and with up-to-date
scenery. But technically the cuts followed the
pattern of Croxall's wood engraver, although with a
slightly greater range of tone. Artistically Bewick's
interpretation was inferior because it was more literal;
it lacked the grander feeling of the earlier work.</p>

<p>Bewick really became the prophet of a new pictorial
style in his <i>A general history of quadrupeds</i>, published in
1790 on wove paper (see figs. 8, 9, and 10). Here his
animals and little vignetted tailpieces of observations
in the country announced an original subject for illustration
and a fresh treatment of wood engraving,
although some designs were still copied from earlier
models. The white line begins to function with
greater elasticity; tones and details beyond anything
known previously in the medium appear with the
force of innovation. The paper was still somewhat
coarse and the cuts were often gray and muddy. But
the audacity of the artist in venturing tonal subtleties
was immediately apparent.</p>

<p>One of Bewick's old friends at Newcastle had been
William Bulmer, who by the 1790's had become a
famous printer. In 1795 he published an edition of
<i>Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell</i>, which was preceded by
an Advertisement announcing his intentions:</p>

<blockquote><p>The present volume ... [is] particularly meant to

<span class="smcap">ENGRAVING</span>, and <span class="smcap">PAPER-MAKING</span>.... The ornaments are
all engraved on blocks of wood, by two of my earliest
acquaintances, Messrs. Bewick [Thomas and his brother
and apprentice John], of Newcastle upon Tyne and London,
after designs made from the most interesting passages of the
Poems they embellish. They have been executed with
great care, and I may venture to say, without being supposed
to be influenced by ancient friendship, that they form the
most extraordinary effort of the art of engraving upon
wood that ever was produced in any age, or any country.
Indeed it seems almost impossible that such delicate effects
could be obtained from blocks of wood. Of the Paper,
it is only necessary to say that it comes from the manufactory
of Mr. Whatman.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following year, 1796, a companion volume, <i>The
Chase, a Poem</i>, by William Somervile, appeared with
cuts by Bewick after drawings by his brother John
(see fig. 11). In both books, although no acknowledgment
was given, there was considerable assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_196" id="p_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
from pupils Robert and John Johnson and Charlton
Nesbit, as well as from an artist associate Richard
Westall.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Bulmer was quite conscious that a new
era in printing and illustration had begun. Updike<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
notes Bulmer's recognition of the achievements of both
Baskerville and Bewick in giving the art of printing a
new basis:</p>

<blockquote><p>To understand the causes of the revival of English
printing which marked the last years of the century, we
must remember that by 1775 Baskerville was dead....
There seems to have been a temporary lull in English fine
printing and the kind of type-founding that contributed to
it. The wood-engraving of Thomas Bewick, produced
about 1780, called, nevertheless, for more brilliant and
delicate letter-press than either Caslon's or Wilson's
types could supply. If Baskerville's fonts had been available,
no doubt they would have served.... So the
next experiments in typography were made by a little
coterie composed of the Boydells, the Nicols, the Bewicks
(Thomas and John), and Bulmer.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the cuts in this book are compared with
earlier impressions from wood blocks, the difference
is quickly seen. The blocks are more highly wrought,
yet every line is crisp and clear and the impressions
are black and brilliant. When we realize that the
only new technological factor of any consequence was
the use of good smooth wove paper, we can appreciate
its significance.</p>

<p>There were no other developments of note in the
practice of printing during the 18th century. The old
wooden hand press, unimproved except for minor devices,
was still in universal use. Ink was little
improved; paper was handmade; type was made from
hand moulds. The ink was still applied by dabbing
with inking balls of wool-stuffed leather nailed to
wooden forms. The leather was still kept soft by removing
it and soaking it in urine, after which it was
trampled for some time to complete the unsavory
operation. Paper still had to be dampened overnight
before printing, and freshly inked sheets were still
hung to dry over cords stretched across the room.</p>

<p>But with a more sympathetic surface for receiving
ink from relief blocks, a new avenue for wood engraving
was now open. In the following year, 1797, the
first volume of Bewick's finest and best-known work
was published. This was the <i>History of British birds</i>,
for which he and his pupils did the cuts while Ralph
Beilby, his partner and former master, provided the
descriptions (see figs. 12, 13, and 14.) It achieved
an immense and instantaneous popularity that carried
the artist's name over the British Isles. The attractiveness
of the subject, the freshness of the medium&mdash;which
could render the softness of feathers and could
be interspersed with text&mdash;the powerful and decorative
little tail pieces, and the comparative inexpensiveness
of the volumes, brought the <i>Birds</i> into homes everywhere.</p>

<p>Actually, wood engraving was not immediately
adopted on a wide scale. Having done without it
for so long, printers and publishers made no concerted
rush to avail themselves of the new type of
cuts. Bewick's pupils found little of this kind of
work to do before about 1830. Luke Clennell dropped
engraving for painting; William Harvey restricted
himself to drawing and designing; Charlton Nesbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_197" id="p_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and John Jackson remained engravers, as did a host
of lesser individuals. Dobson says:<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The pupils who quitted him to seek their fortunes in
London either made their way with difficulty, or turned to
other pursuits, and the real popularization of wood-engraving
did not take place until some years after his death.</p></blockquote>

<p>One reason for delay in adopting the new technique
may have been the danger of the block splitting, or
of the sections of wood coming apart at the mortise-joints
during the printing operation. If this happened,
work had to be suspended until a new block was
engraved, or until the sections were reglued. For
periodicals with deadlines, this was a serious hazard.</p>

<h2><a name="Wood_Engraving_and_the_Stereotype" id="Wood_Engraving_and_the_Stereotype"></a>Wood Engraving and the Stereotype</h2>


<p>In any event, wood engraving did not really flourish
until a practical stereotyping process was perfected.
By this procedure substitute blocks of type metal
could replace the wood engravings in the press, and
the danger of splitting the block was eliminated.
The first steps of any importance toward a practical
process were made by the Earl of Stanhope around
1800, but not until Claude Genoux in France, between
1828 and 1829, developed the papier mâché
or wet mat process could acceptable stereotypes of
entire pages be produced.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> By this method, patented
on July 24, 1829, and others that followed, a number
of duplicate plates of each page could be made as
required for rapid printing on a battery of presses.
Wood engraving now emerged as a practical method
of illustration for popular publications. The <i>Penny
Magazine</i> and the <i>Saturday Magazine</i>, founded in
1832, immediately made use of Genoux's stereotyping
process. Dobson<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> describes the effect of these
periodicals:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The art of wood engraving received an astonishing
impact from these publications. The engraver, instead of
working merely with his own hands, has been obliged to
take five or six pupils to get through the work." (Mr.
Cowper's evidence before the Select Committee on Arts
and Manufactures, 1835). It is difficult nowadays [1884]
to understand what a revelation these two periodicals, with
their representations of far countries and foreign animals,
of masterpieces of painting and sculpture, were to middle-class
households fifty years ago.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>We will not pursue Bewick's career further. With
habits of hard work deeply ingrained, he kept at his
bench until his death in 1828, engraving an awesome
quantity of cuts. But he never surpassed his work
on the <i>Birds</i>, although his reputation grew in proportion
to the spread of wood engraving throughout
the world.</p>

<p>The medium became more and more detailed, and
eventually rivaled photography in its minute variations
of tone (see figs. 15 and 16). But printing wood
engravings never was a problem again. Not only was
wove paper always used in this connection, but it had
become much cheaper through the invention of a machine
for producing it in lengths. Nicholas Louis
Robert, in France, had developed and exhibited such
an apparatus in 1797, at the instigation of M. Didot.
John Gamble in England, working with Henry and
Charles Fourdrinier, engaged a fine mechanic, Bryan
Donkin, to build a machine on improved principles.
The first comparatively successful one was completed
in 1803. It was periodically improved, and wove
paper appeared in increasing quantities. Spicer<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
says: "Naturally these improvements and economies
in the manufacture of paper were accompanied by a
corresponding increase in output. Where, in 1806, a
machine was capable of making 6 cwt. in twelve hours,
in 1813 it could turn out double that quantity in the
same time at one quarter the expense."</p>

<p>At about the same time the all-iron Stanhope press
began to be manufactured in quantity, and shortly the
new inking roller invented by the indispensable Earl
came into use to supplant the old inking balls. Later
in the century (there is no need to go into specific detail
here) calendered and coated papers were introduced,
and wood engraving on these glossy papers became a
medium that could reproduce wash drawings, crayon
drawings, pencil drawings, and oil paintings so faithfully
that all the original textures were apparent.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The engraver, concerned entirely with accurate reproduction,
became little more than a mechanic who
rendered pictures drawn on the blocks by an artist.
In time, photographic processes came to be used for
transferring pictures to the blocks and eventually, of
course, photomechanical halftones replaced the wood
engraver altogether.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The electrotyping process, which came into prominence in
1839 through the experiments of Professor Jacobi in St. Petersburg
and Jordan and Spencer in England, had made it possible
to produce substitute plates of the highest fidelity. For fine
work, these were much superior to stereotyping.</p></div>

</div>

<p>Bewick was an artist, not a reproductive craftsman.
His blocks were conceived as original engravings, not
as imitations of tones and textures created in another
medium. If wood engraving advanced in the direction
of commercialism to fill an overwhelming mass
need, it was only because he had given it a technical
basis. But it had greater artistic potentialities, as
proved by Blake, Calvert, and Lepére, among others,
and has found new life in the engravers of the 20th-century
revival.</p>

<p>The reasons for Bewick's remarkable effectiveness
can now be summed up. He succeeded, first, because
he was the natural inheritor of a specifically English
graphic arts process, burin-engraving on the end
grain of wood. This had been practiced almost
solely in England, which lacked a woodcut tradition,
for about 75 years before the date he finished his
apprenticeship. We know from Jackson's contemporary
account that end-grain wood engraving was
standard practice in England from about 1700.
Bewick merely continued and refined a medium that
came down to him as a national tradition.</p>

<p>Secondly, his country isolation and lack of academic
training saved him from the inanity of repeating the
old decorative devices&mdash;trophies, cartouches, classical
figures, Roman ruins, and other international conventions
that had lost their significance by the 1780's,
although a spurious classicism was still kept alive for
genteel consumption and the romantic picturesque
still persisted in interior decoration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_201" id="p_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i031a.jpg" width="700" height="564" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thirdly, he looked at life and nature with a fresh
eye, without preconceptions. While his lack of larger
vision held him down as an artist, it contributed to
his feeling for natural textures and story-telling detail.
His approach to illustration, therefore, was the
spontaneous expression of an observant but unimaginative
nature, coated with a bitter-sweet sentiment.
It was this quality, so homely and common and yet
so charged with integrity, that delivered the shock
of recognition to a mass audience.</p>

<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly in the long
run, he was fortunate enough to live at a time when
a necessary prerequisite for the physical appearance
of his work, wove paper, was coming into use. Without
it he would soon have had to simplify his line
system, returning to older and less detailed methods,
or his work would have remained unprintable.
It was the new paper that allowed him to extract
unprecedented subtleties from the wood block, that
made his cuts print clearly and evenly, and that
encouraged the expansion of the wood engraving
process. These factors, taken together, make up
the phenomenon of Thomas Bewick.</p>
